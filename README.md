# SICP-Practice
personal SCIP practice - on progress


## VSCode Setting

Extension : [Magic Racket](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evzen-wybitul.magic-racket)

```
brew install minimal-racket
```
and follow Magic Racket's instruction.


## note
* unlike [mit-scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/), racket don't allow re-define identifier. so some of my code has problems.

* paint/painters.ss from [nosyu](https://nosyu.pe.kr/1354)
